QR scan verification 

## The problem
There is currently an increase in online sales in an exponential way.  This new business model leads to delegate, in many cases, the transport of goods to external companies. In many cases, complaints are received from customers who say they have not received the package or have received the wrong package. 

## Flow
1. The user will have to be registered in the application.
2. When he makes a purchase the money of the cost of the good of his etherum-account will be blocked. At that time a QR code will be sent to him.
3. When the delivery man executes the delivery of the package, he must verify the QR code through the application. At that time the payment will be executed.
